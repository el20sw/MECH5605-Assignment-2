% - get average accuracy from leaving out each subject
% - do some feature selection by randomly sampling from features and
% measuring accuracy?
% - find the 15 most useful features and report on these for the ANN

% for each feature row in each data file, it need the activity to be appended to the features and the person needs to be known
% then we can split the data into training and testing sets - we can use leave-one-subject-out cross-validation

% 1. get the features and labels
% 2. split the data into training and testing sets
% 3. define and train the neural network
% 4. test the neural network
% 5. confusion matrix
